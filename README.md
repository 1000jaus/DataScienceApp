# Analysis and Model Evaluation with Streamlit
Welcome to Analysis and Model Evaluation with Streamlit! This interactive application is designed to facilitate data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation. Ideal for data scientists, analysts, and developers, this tool will allow you to explore, transform, and evaluate your data with ease.

# 📦 Main Features
## 📊 Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
Graphical Visualization: Generate graphs to understand the distribution of each variable (univariate analysis) and the relationships between variables (bivariate analysis).
Statistical Analysis: Obtain key metrics such as means, medians, standard deviations, and correlations.
## 🔧 Data Preprocessing
Data Imputation: Fill in missing values using different strategies (mean, median, mode).
Standardization: Normalize and standardize the data to improve model performance.
Feature Selection: Choose the most relevant variables for your model using advanced selection techniques.
## 🏆 Model Ranking and Evaluation
Regression and Classification Models: Evaluate more than 25 different models, both for regression and classification. Finally 
, visualize a performance-ranked dashboard, making it easier to compare and select the best model for your problem.
